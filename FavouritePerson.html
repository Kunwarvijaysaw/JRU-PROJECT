                Engineering from Madras Institute of Technology. Dr. Kalam made significant contribution as Project Director to develop India's 
                first indigenous Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully injected the Rohini satellite in the near earth orbit in 
                July 1980 and made India an exclusive member of Space Club. He was responsible for the evolution of ISRO's launch vehicle 
                programme, particularly the PSLV configuration. After working for two decades in ISRO and mastering launch vehicle technologies,
                 Dr. Kalam took up the responsibility of developing Indigenous Guided Missiles at Defence Research and Development Organisation

             <h1 style="color: white;"><u>Mahatma Gandhi</u></h1>
             <p style="font-size: 20px;color: white;">Mahatma Gandhi, born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, Gujarat, was a prominent leader of India’s independence movement and is
                 revered as the "Father of the Nation." Deeply influenced by his mother’s religious beliefs and Jain values of non-violence 
                 (Ahimsa), Gandhi carried these principles throughout his life. After studying law in London, he moved to South Africa in 1896,
                  where he witnessed racial discrimination and began his journey of social and political activism using nonviolent resistance 
                  or *Satyagraha*. Returning to India, he led mass movements such as the Non-Cooperation Movement, Salt March, and Quit India 
                  Movement, advocating peaceful protest against British rule. Gandhi was imprisoned multiple times but remained committed to
                   truth, simplicity, and social reform, especially in fighting untouchability and promoting rural development and khadi.
                    He played a key role in mobilizing Indian society and uniting people across religions and castes. His refusal to support 
                    violence, even during World War II, brought both praise and criticism. Gandhi opposed the partition of India but stepped 
                    aside as younger leaders like Nehru and Patel supported it. In his final years, he worked tirelessly to stop communal 
                    violence, fasting to promote Hindu-Muslim unity. On January 30, 1948, he was assassinated in Delhi by Nathuram Godse, 
                    a Hindu extremist. Gandhi's life, rooted in spiritual strength and moral courage, inspired global leaders like Martin 
                    Luther King Jr. and Nelson Mandela, and his philosophy of nonviolence remains a guiding light for peace and justice 
                    movements around the world.

            <h1 style="color: white;"><u>Dr. B.R. Ambedkar</u></h1>
            <p style="color: white;font-size: 20;">Dr. Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar, popularly known as Babasaheb Ambedkar, was born on April 14, 1891, in Mhow (now in Madhya Pradesh) 
                as the 14th and last child of his parents. His father, Subedar Ramji Maloji Sakpal, was in the British Army and a follower of 
                Sant Kabir. Born into an untouchable caste, Ambedkar faced social discrimination from childhood. He received his early education
                 in Bombay and later graduated from Elphinstone College with the support of a scholarship from the Maharaja of Baroda. Selected 
                 for higher studies, he earned M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from Columbia University, and later a D.Sc. and Bar-at-Law from London. 
                 Despite his outstanding qualifications, caste discrimination persisted even after returning to India. He took up various 
                 academic roles, practiced law, and founded institutions for the upliftment of the depressed classes. In 1924, he established 
                 the Bahishkrit Hitkarini Sabha to promote education and social reforms for Dalits. He was a powerful orator, professor, 
                 economist, and social reformer who fearlessly challenged the caste system. In 1935, at Yeola, he publicly declared he would 
                 not die a Hindu, and in 1956, he embraced Buddhism along with thousands of his followers. He served as the Labour Member in
                  the Viceroy’s Executive Council in 1942 and was elected to the Constituent Assembly in 1946, playing a key role in drafting 
                  the Indian Constitution, earning him the title "Architect of the Indian Constitution." After independence, he became the
                   first Law Minister of India but resigned in 1951 over differences with Nehru. He wrote extensively, including 
                   *The Annihilation of Caste*, *Who Were the Shudras?*, and *Thoughts on Linguistic States*. He was honored with the title of
                    “Bodhisattva” by Buddhist monks in 1954. He also contributed to the foundation of the Reserve Bank of India. On October 14,
                     1956, he converted to Buddhism, and he passed away on December 6, 1956. His death anniversary is observed as 
                     *Mahaparinirvan Diwas*. Dr. Ambedkar dedicated his life to fighting social injustice, promoting equality, and uplifting
                      the marginalized. His life and ideas remain relevant today as India continues to face challenges of social and economic 
                      inequality. His intellectual legacy and relentless struggle for justice make him one of the greatest figures in modern
                       Indian history.

            <h1 style="color: white;"><u>Bhagat Singh</u></h1>
            <p style="color: white;font-size: 20;">Bhagat Singh, one of India’s most iconic revolutionaries, was born on September 28, 1907,
                 in Banga village, Punjab (now in Pakistan), into a patriotic Sikh family involved in India’s freedom struggle. Influenced from
                  a young age by his family’s nationalist ideals and the Jallianwala Bagh massacre of 1919, he grew up with deep resentment 
                  against British colonial rule. He joined the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA) and believed that only a
                   revolutionary approach could free India. Bhagat Singh strongly opposed the non-violent approach of some leaders and instead
                    supported direct action to inspire the masses and shake the foundations of British authority. In 1928, to avenge the death
                     of freedom fighter Lala Lajpat Rai—who had been assaulted during a peaceful protest—Bhagat Singh, along with Rajguru and 
                     Sukhdev, planned and executed the killing of British police officer John Saunders, mistakenly instead of Scott, the officer
                      responsible. To spread awareness, he and Batukeshwar Dutt later threw non-lethal bombs in the Central Legislative Assembly
                       on April 8, 1929, shouting slogans like “Inquilab Zindabad” and surrendering willingly. During his trial and imprisonment,
                        he used the courtroom and his writings to spread revolutionary ideas and highlight British injustices. While in jail, he
                         demanded equal treatment for political prisoners and undertook a historic hunger strike. Bhagat Singh was not only a 
                         fearless revolutionary but also a thinker and writer, deeply influenced by socialism, Marxism, and anti-colonial ideas.
                          He read extensively, including works by Marx, Lenin, and other political philosophers. His essay Why I am an Atheist
                           reveals his rational thinking and deep commitment to human values. Despite widespread support and appeals for clemency,
                            Bhagat Singh, Rajguru, and Sukhdev were executed on March 23, 1931, in Lahore Central Jail at just 23 years of age. 
                            Their execution sparked nationwide protests and further fueled the freedom movement. Bhagat Singh became a martyr and
                             symbol of youthful courage, sacrifice, and revolutionary idealism. His life and death continue to inspire generations,
                              especially youth, to fight injustice and stand for truth. Bhagat Singh remains a national hero, remembered for his
                               fearless defiance of colonial rule and his vision of an India based on equality, freedom, and justice. His martyrdom
                                day, March 23, is observed as Shaheed Diwas across India in his honor.

            <h1 style="color: white;"><u>Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose</u></h1>
            <p style="color: white;font-size: 20;">Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose was an Indian nationalist who led (Second Phase) the Indian National 
                Army (INA) in the independence movement. He was a prominent leader of the INC. Subhas Chandra Bose served as the President of the 
                party for two tenures and the 5th Mayor of Calcutta (now Kolkata). Netaji was the first Indian who traveled in a submarine from Kiel
                 to Tokyo via Singapore. He was one of the greatest freedom fighters of India who escaped under the nose of the Britishers.
                 Today In this article, we are going to discuss the life of an Inconvenient Nationalist who went to Germany, met Hitler, and
                  went to Russia and Japan. After meeting the Japanese Prime Minister General Tojo, he went to Singapore to form India's first 
                  liberation army. Even while staying outside India, he launched the biggest war on the British Government to occupy India.
                   Netaji led India's struggle for independence and guided the nation towards liberation from the cul-de-sac of British 
                   colonial rule. It is nearly impossible to decode his life in a form of biography but we will try to discuss the major points
                    related to his life.Subhas Chandra Bose was born on 23rd January, 1897, in Cuttack, British India. He came from a well-known
                     established Bengali family with a strong tradition of civil service. His father Mr. Janakinath Bose was a successful lawyer.
                      His mother Prabhavati Devi was a social and educational enthusiast. He was baccalaureate from the Presidency College and he
                       started to take his stand against the British from this time. Reportedly incensed by accounts of Oaten's racist comments
                        to Indians and his high-handed behavior toward his Indian students, Subhas beat him with his slippers and threw him down
                         the iconic main staircase of Presidency College. He was influenced by the purity, patience and perseverance ideologies 
                         of Swami Vivekananda and Ramakrishna. He worshiped Sakti and Kali. At the age of sixteen, he read all the Vedas and
                          Upanishads. Then his parents sent him to the University of Cambridge in England for the Indian Civil Services. In 1920
                           he passed the civil service examination but he did not want to do "Chakri" under the British Government. In April 1921
                            when the nationalist turmoils in India were at their peak, he resigned from ICS and came back to India. Subhas Chandra
                             Bose showed the early signs of leadership and a strong sense of patriotism entire his school and college life.
                              Bose was a brilliant student who was knowledgeable in Indian history and literature from an early age.
